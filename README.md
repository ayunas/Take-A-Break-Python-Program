# Take-A-Break-Python-Program
An Assignment in the Udacity Course: Programming Foundations in Python.

This small program is written in Python to allow a user to take a set number of breaks.  

The user specifies the # of breaks they want to take, as well as how long should they be allowed to work before the break time comes.  

After the break time comes, the program launches a web browser and plays a youtube video.
